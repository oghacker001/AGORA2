# 🎉 AGORA - Blockchain Voting Platform - COMPLETE

## ✅ Project Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Your blockchain-powered voting platform is now complete with full integration between frontend, backend, and blockchain!

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend** (Next.js) - Port 3000
2. **Backend** (Express + TypeScript) - Port 5000
3. **Database** (MongoDB Atlas)
4. **Blockchain** (Hardhat Local Network) - Port 8545

## 🔑 Pre-configured Admin Accounts

### Admin Account
- **Unique ID**: `ADMIN-AGR-001`
- **Phone**: `8888888001`
- **MPIN**: `1234`
- **Role**: Admin (can verify users)

### Election Commission Account
- **Unique ID**: `EC-AGR-001`
- **Phone**: `7777777001`

- **Role**: Election Commission (can create elections)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Start Hardhat Blockchain Node
```powershell
cd blockchain
npx hardhat node
```
Keep this terminal running. It provides the local Ethereum network.

### 2. Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd server
npm run dev
```
Backend runs on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Start Frontend
```powershell
cd client
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

## 📋 Complete User Flows

### Flow 1: Admin Login
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
2. Enter Unique ID: `ADMIN-AGR-001`
3. Click "Request OTP"
4. Check backend console for OTP (6-digit code)
5. Enter OTP and MPIN: `1234`
6. ✅ Logged in as Admin

### Flow 2: Voter Registration
1. Click "Register" tab on auth page
2. Fill registration form with:
   - Full name
   - Phone (10 digits)
   - Email
   - Aadhaar (12 digits)
   - Address
   - Age
   - Voter ID
3. Upload Aadhaar Card PDF
4. Upload Voter ID Card PDF
5. Submit registration
6. ✅ Registration pending admin approval

### Flow 3: Admin Verifies User
1. Login as Admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard → Pending Users
3. Review user documents
4. Click "Verify User"
5. Set initial MPIN for user (4 digits)
6. ✅ User verified, SBT token issued on blockchain
7. User receives unique ID (format: `AGR-XXXXXXX`)

### Flow 4: Election Commission Creates Election
1. Login as EC (`EC-AGR-001`)
2. Go to EC Dashboard → Create Election
3. Fill election details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Start Date
   - End Date
   - Parties (name, symbol, manifesto)
4. Click "Create Election"
5. ✅ Election created in MongoDB AND blockchain

### Flow 5: Verified User Votes
1. User logs in with their unique ID
2. See active elections
3. Select an election
4. Review party manifestos
5. Cast vote for preferred party
6. ✅ Vote recorded in MongoDB AND blockchain (immutable)

## 🔐 Blockchain Integration Points

### 1. User Verification (SBT Issuance)
**When**: Admin verifies a user
**What Happens**:
- User gets blockchain wallet address
- Non-transferable SBT (Soulbound Token) issued
- Token stored in User document
- Contract: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`

### 2. Election Creation
**When**: EC creates election
**What Happens**:
- Election details stored on blockchain
- Transaction hash saved in MongoDB
- Immutable record of election parameters
- Contract: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`

### 3. Vote Casting
**When**: User votes in election
**What Happens**:
- Vote recorded in MongoDB (fast query)
- Vote recorded on blockchain (immutable proof)
- Double-vote prevention at both layers
- Transaction hash stored with vote

## 🔍 Verify Blockchain Data

### Check Contract Addresses
```javascript
// In Node.js console or browser console
const deployments = require('./blockchain/deployments/localhost.json')
console.log('SBT Contract:', deployments.contracts.SBT)
console.log('Voting Contract:', deployments.contracts.VotingContract)
```

### Verify Vote on Blockchain
```javascript
// Using ethers.js
const { ethers } = require('ethers')
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545')
const votingContract = new ethers.Contract(
  '0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512',
  VotingABI,
  provider
)

// Check total votes
const totalVotes = await votingContract.getTotalVotes(electionId)
console.log('Total votes on blockchain:', totalVotes.toString())
```

NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_KEY=agora_dev_2024
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Problem**: Contract not initialized
- **Solution**: Ensure Hardhat node is running and contracts are deployed

### Frontend Issues
- **Problem**: API calls failing
- **Solution**: Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL points to correct backend

### Blockchain Issues
- **Problem**: Transactions failing
- **Solution**: Restart Hardhat node and redeploy contracts

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email/SMS Services**: Real OTP delivery (currently console)
2. **Results Visualization**: Charts and graphs for election results
3. **Vote Verification**: Let users verify their vote on blockchain
4. **Multiple Elections**: Support concurrent elections
5. **Proposal System**: Implement proposal voting
6. **Deploy to Testnet**: Move from local to Sepolia/Mumbai
7. **Mobile App**: React Native version
8. **Advanced Security**: Encryption, rate limiting, etc.

## 🎓 How to Demo

1. **Show Admin Flow**: Register → Verify → Show SBT on blockchain
2. **Show EC Flow**: Create election → Show on blockchain
3. **Show Voter Flow**: Login → Vote → Show vote on blockchain
4. **Show Immutability**: Try to vote twice (prevented)
5. **Show Transparency**: Query blockchain for vote counts

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check all three services are running (Frontend, Backend, Blockchain)
2. Verify environment variables are correct
3. Check console logs for errors
4. Ensure MongoDB connection is active
