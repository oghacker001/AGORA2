## 🎯 For the Hackathon

### What to Say:

**Problem:**
"Citizens can't participate in local governance. Current systems are unreliable and can be manipulated. Migrant workers have to travel home to vote."

**Solution:**
"Agora uses blockchain and Soulbound Tokens to create a secure, transparent, and inclusive voting platform. Each citizen gets a non-transferable digital identity. All votes are recorded on blockchain, making them tamper-proof."

**Demo:**
[Show the 5-minute demo above]

**Technical Highlights:**
- "Full-stack application with Next.js and Node.js"
- "Blockchain integration with Solidity smart contracts"
- "Soulbound Tokens for identity"
- "Real-time dashboards with live data"

**Impact:**
- "Enables remote voting for millions of migrants"
- "Prevents vote manipulation with blockchain"
- "Increases civic participation"
- "Makes democracy more accessible"
