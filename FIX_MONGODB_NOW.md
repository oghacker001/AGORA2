## ⚡ QUICK FIX (Choose One):

### Option 1: I'll Do It For You (Tell Me Password)
Just reply with your MongoDB password and I'll update the file automatically.

### Option 2: You Do It Manually (30 seconds)

#### Step 1: Open This File
```
C:\Users\gupta\OneDrive\Desktop\AGORA\server\.env
```

#### Step 2: Find Line 7
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ranjugupta1106_db_user:<db_password>@cluster0.4m1ko09.mongodb.net/agora?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

#### Step 3: Replace `<db_password>` with Your ACTUAL Password
**Example:** If your password is `MyPass123`, change to:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ranjugupta1106_db_user:MyPass123@cluster0.4m1ko09.mongodb.net/agora?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## 💡 Pro Tip

Your password might have special characters. If it does, you need to URL encode them:

| Character | Encode As |
|-----------|-----------|
| `@` | `%40` |
| `#` | `%23` |
| `$` | `%24` |
| `%` | `%25` |
| `&` | `%26` |
| `/` | `%2F` |
| `:` | `%3A` |

**Example:**
- Password: `Pass@123#`
- Encoded: `Pass%40123%23`
