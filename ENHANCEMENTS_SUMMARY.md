## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
cd server

# Install Hardhat (if not already)
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-user-registry.js --network mumbai
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-voting.js --network mumbai
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Add to `server/.env`:
```env
USER_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...  # After deployment
VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...         # After deployment
SBT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...            # Existing
```

### 3. Use New Components

#### Logo in Your Components
```tsx
import { Logo } from "@/components/logo"

<Logo size="md" showText={true} animate={false} />
```

#### Animated Cards
```tsx
import { AnimatedCard, FadeIn, SlideIn } from "@/components/animated-card"

<AnimatedCard delay={0.2} hover={true}>
  <div>Your content</div>
</AnimatedCard>
```

#### Animated Buttons
```tsx
import { AnimatedButton, ShimmerButton } from "@/components/animated-button"

<ShimmerButton onClick={handleVote}>
  Vote Now
</ShimmerButton>
```

### 4. Integrate Blockchain Services

```typescript
import { UserRegistryService } from '@/blockchain/userRegistryService'

const userRegistry = new UserRegistryService()

// Register user on blockchain
await userRegistry.registerUser(
  walletAddress,
  encryptedAadhaar,
  name,
  email,
  phone,
  did,
  sbtTokenId
)

// Verify user (admin only)
await userRegistry.verifyUser(userAddress, adminName)

// Get user data
const user = await userRegistry.getUser(walletAddress)

// Get user history
const history = await userRegistry.getUserHistory(walletAddress)
```
